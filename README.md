using the [dlt](https://github.com/dlt-hub/dlt) library.

- [sql_to_weaviate.ipynb](sql_to_weaviate.ipynb): shows how to import data from a public MySQL database into Weaviate.
- [zendesk_to_weaviate.ipynb](zendesk_to_weaviate.ipynb): loads data from a [Zendesk dlt source](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/zendesk) into Weaviate.
