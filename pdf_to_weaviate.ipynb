    "Data Ingestion: The project starts with the ingestion of unstructured data, specifically PDF files containing invoices. These PDF files are processed to extract text information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Transformation: Once the text is extracted and stored in Weaviate, it is further processed to extract structured information such as recipient company name, invoice amount, invoice date, invoice number, and service description using a generative prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Storage: The structured information is then stored in a Weaviate database, which allows for efficient querying and retrieval of this structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this project aims to automate the extraction and querying of structured information from unstructured invoice PDFs, making it easier to work with and derive insights from this data."
